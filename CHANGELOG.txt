2.1:
 - Correctly use colored names everywhere when usedisplaynames is enabled in the configuration
 - Made the god component use the "god" entity metadata tag. This allows other plugins
    to more easily hook into CommandBook's godmode implementation.

 - Added support for spawning 'friendly' iron golems and setting villager profession
 - Updated sessions framework to allow it to handle multiple types of sessions (for developers!)

 - Moved uses of CreatureType over to EntityType
 - Update for 1.2

    format. Currently only handles MyHomes and warpz0r databases. (homeconvert.py)
 - Make sure all accesses of HelpComponent's messages field are lowercased
 - Add a damage value check to per-item permissions. commandbook.items.<id> allows
    id with any damage value, commandbook.items.<id>.<damage> allows item <id> with <damage>
 - Made EntityUtil.matchCreatureType() ignore case when checking creature type names
 - Have OnlineListComponent use the global use-dsplay-names setting instead of its colored-names one
 - Set the time lock delay to a default value that is not 0.
    **Warning**: To avoid issues when using existing installations, change component.time.time-lock.delay to 20 in config.yml
 - Fix warp loading messages for per-world warps

2.0
 - Fixed /home permissions checks. commandbook.home.other to teleport anybody to a home owned by a user who is not the sender commandbook.home.teleport.other to teleport other users to homes.
 - Add permissions to exempt kick/ban/mute for specific players  - see wiki for detairs

 - Moved /heal, /stack, /locate, /slay, and /god from WorldGuard
 - Improve handling of warps stored in unloaded worlds. This fixes #701 (well it should, but I don't have a fancy multiworld setup to test with).
 - Added twitter-style pm's, using the @name syntax
 - /take command to remove items from a player's inventory
 - /freeze component
 - Added support for loading components from a directory of class files.
